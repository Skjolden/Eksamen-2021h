                <h2>Start of first semester</h2>
                <img src="images/oslomet.png" alt="First time at Oslomet">
                <p>
                    The first year of transition from work life to studying at Oslo-met felt like a bigger jump and different than earlier education.
                     I did not expect it to be that much different than upper-secondary school, but the differences surprised me.
                    The education is much more hands on and related to specific topics than it was in earlier educations and that makes it easier to 
                    focus on it since it is something I am interested in. The responsibility of being a student instead of a pupil is also different 
                    since now you are yourself responsible for your will to learn. The teacher will no longer call your parents if you do bad on a test
                     or fail an assignment. It is now your responsibility to recognise how you can improve. 

                    Another thing that affected the start of this semester was the fact that COVID-19 regulations were still not yet fully lifted.
                    Which meant that most of the seminars were done digitally. This was a bitter sweet experience since I did enjoy learning and studying 
                    from the comfort of my own home, but at the same time I also missed being in a professional learning environment where the focus was 
                    studying and improving along with other people with the same mindset.
                </p>
                <h2>Learning to code</h2>
                <img src="images/coding.png" alt="First time coding">
                <p>
                    I did have some prior experience with coding within python, but not enough to call myself good at it. This semester the main focus within
                    coding was on JAVA and HTML. Two languages that I had no prior experience with. 
                    <ul> <li><strong>HTML</strong></li></ul>
                    Something that surprised me was when I was told that HTML is not a coding language, but a way to format the website. HTML does not have any 
                    programming logic for it to be considered a programming language, so it is instead considered a markup language. HTML made me realise that 
                    within programming there are different avenues to pursue for different interests. Which was a comforting thought because there is a higher 
                    chance you will find something that you are interested in.
                    </p>

                        <img src="images/html.png" alt="HTML is not programming">

                    <p>

                    <ul><li><strong>JAVA</strong></li></ul>
                    Java felt more familiar to me since I had some experience with python which is another programming language that does utilize programming logic.
                     Prior to this I only had experience with the basics of Python, but learning JAVA made me realize how varied and how many ways you can use coding 
                     to make your idea of a program come to reality. 

                    Something I learned while learning JAVA is that with more experience and knowledge about programming you can be more creative with your approach to 
                    the problem you are trying to solve. This means that as you improve with programming you will more freely be able to communicate your intentions to 
                    a format in code that does what you wish it to do. 

                    A good comparison would be that learning several methods and techniques within JAVA is comparable to learning more words in a language. 
                    If you know more words in a language you can then say the same sentence in different ways or in a way that feels more comfortable with you.
