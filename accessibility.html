                <h1>Accessibility</h1>
                <p>
                    For the initial automatic test for WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) we used a website called <a href="https://achecker.achecks.ca/checker/index.php" >AChecker</a> which is a site that checks html documents for accessibility issues 
                    using WCAG 2.0. 
                   
                    We avoided having any known problems according to the website to make the accessibility more comfortable. <br>
                    <img src="images/known.PNG" alt="Image of amount of known issues"> <br>
                    We also checked the 
                    Potential problems tab within the website <br>
                    <img src="images/potential.PNG" alt="Image of amount of potential issues"> <br>
                    This was to make sure there was not something we had missed. We made sure out Alt texts for images specified 
                    that this text is replacing an image as to not cause confusion and were careful to use <strong>&lt;strong&gt;</strong> for points instead of <strong>&lt;b&gt;</strong> 
                    as &lt;b&gt; or bold is decorative 
                        and does not affect the way accessibility software interacts with the content. 

                    Some other accessibility choices we made include picking contrasting colors for background and the content that is supposed to be shown to the user. This makes it
                    more comfortable to read and does not interfere with the experience. We also avoided using css to include images of importance since most accessiblity software does
                    not interact with css code as it does with the html code. Paragraphs and the formatting of the content was also deemed important by the group as to not overflow one 
                    segment with information about various topics that would be more understandable split up. 

                    We also took different screen sizes and devices into account and formatted a version of the website for both smaller screens for mobile devices and bigger screens such
                    as laptops and monitors. This makes it an overall smoother experience to access the website from any device. 

                    The file size of images was also taken into account as to not make the toll that loading the images take on the device and network higher than is needed. This could
                    be especially important for users with slower network speeds or users with limited mobile network capacity.
