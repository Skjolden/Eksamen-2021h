                The political consequences of the Internet.
            </h2>
            <p>
                One of the newer developments on the Internet are the use of algorithms to specially cater content for the user. 
                The webpages you visit gather data using “cookies”, and tailors content based on what your interests are. 
                This is primarily used within advertisement for products and services. 
                But in recent times, we have seen that it can be used for political advertisement. 
                Political lobby groups, parties and news sources can now reach people sharing the same political viewpoints. 
                A dire consequence of this is that people fall down an echo chamber, 
                where they are primarily exposed to the political opinions they themselves agree with (also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias" target="_blank">"confirmation bias"</a>). 
                We also see a tendency towards articles with more extreme opinions generating more click and share activity, 
                which can have dire consequences for the political climate, where the extreme outer-wing parties gain more power.
                <br>
                <br>
                On the internet it is very attractive for big publications to generate clicks on their articles. 
                This means journalists often focuses more on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait" target="_blank">“clickbait”</a> titles, 
                so that people will click on their articles, instead of making a thorough and well written journalistic work.
                On webpages like Facebook, its often just the title of the article that’s visible before you click on the link. 
                This makes it easy for people who don’t read the article to develop their own opinions about different political parties in Norway, 
                or even Presidential candidates in the US.
                The titles are often out of context and can set the individual who the article refers to in a bad light. 
                In the articles there are often comment sections where anyone can leave a comment.
                On the internet it is easy to make an anonymous profile that gives people with bad intentions the tools spread fake news and false information that can influence people’s political opinions.
